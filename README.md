## PuppFinder

*Find your perfect beloved pup...*

In this term, I propose to design an application that will help prospective dog owners 
find their perfect pup or people who are just merely interested in dogs find more about 
dog breeds and their characteristics. Not all dog lovers are experts on dog breeds. 
Often, people describe the types of dogs they like with the dog's physical or 
behavioural characteristics such as size, fur coat, playfulness, and friendliness towards others. 

Here, the PuppFinder application will construct a set of questions that covers a wide variety of dog characteristics 
including the dog breed which will guide users to discovering their ideal pup. The application 
will provide the results of the questionaire where users will be able to find more information
about the different dog breeds. Consequently, the user can narrow down their choices in a wish list.
Furthermore, the user will be able to rate the quality of service from the PuppFinder application.
-print out the final wish list where the user can review, and select the breed they wish to own

This project really interests me because I am a dog lover myself and wish to own a dog 
one day. Nonetheless, I do not know much about all the types of dogs besides the popular
names such as a Poodle or a Chihuahua. There is just too many types and I often don't know where 
to start looking. Choosing a dog to take care of can be quite challenging for new dog owners.
Therefore, I hope that this application can help me and other people 
who are interested dogs but do not know a lot about dog breeds learn more about the different types based on the
preferred characteristics, and narrow down our options.
