## PuppFinder

*Find your perfect beloved pup...*

In this term, I propose to design an application that will help prospective dog owners 
find their perfect pup. Not all dog lovers are experts on dog breeds. 
Often, people describe a dog by their unique characteristics such as size, 
fur coat, level of intelligence, and playfulness. 

*The PuppFinder application will:*
- construct a set of questions that covers a wide variety of dog characteristics 
including the dog breed which will guide users to discovering their ideal pup
- provide the list of dog breed names in which the user can select view the 
corresponding picture and information in detail
- allow the user to **like** a particular type of dog breed and add it to their wish list
- print out the final wish list where the user can review, and select the breed they wish to own

This project really interests me because I am a dog lover myself and wish to own a dog 
one day. Nonetheless, I do not know much about all the types of dogs besides the popular
names such as a Poodle or a Chihuahua. There is just too many to remember and I just want the one! 
What I do know is that my desired dog is has to be not too big in size, 
fluffy, and possibly energetic. Therefore, I hope that this application 
can help me and other people who are interested in owning a dog but do not 
know all the dog breeds by heart narrow down their options based on their 
preferred characteristics.
