## PuppFinder

*Find your perfect beloved pup...*

In this term, I propose to design an application that will help prospective dog owners 
find their perfect pup or people who are just merely interested in dogs find more about 
their characteristics. Not all dog lovers are experts on dog breeds. 
Often, people describe the types of dogs they like with the dog's physical or 
behavioural characteristics such as size, fur coat, 
level of intelligence, and playfulness. 

Here, the PuppFinder application will:
- construct a set of questions that covers a wide variety of dog characteristics 
including the dog breed which will guide users to discovering their ideal pup
- provide the list of dog breed names in which the user can select view the 
corresponding picture and information in detail
- allow the user to **like** a particular type of dog breed and add it to 
their wish list collection
- print out the final wish list where the user can review, and select the breed they wish to own

This project really interests me because I am a dog lover myself and wish to own a dog 
one day. Nonetheless, I do not know much about all the types of dogs besides the popular
names such as a Poodle or a Chihuahua. There is just too many types and I don't know where 
to start looking. What I do know is that my desired dog has to be not too big in size, 
fluffy, and possibly energetic. I've seen them before but I do not know what the name 
of the breed is. Therefore, I hope that this application can help me and other people 
who are interested dogs but do not know all the dog breeds by heart learn more about the different types based on the
preferred characteristics, and narrow down our options.
