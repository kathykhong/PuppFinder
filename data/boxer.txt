Boxer Highlights

-Boxers are high-energy dogs and need a lot of exercise. Make sure you have the time, desire, and energy to give them the play and activity they need.

-Boxers are exuberant and will greet you ecstatically.

-Early, consistent training is critical--before your Boxer gets too big to handle!

-Although they are large, Boxers are not "outdoor dogs." Their short noses and short hair make them uncomfortable in hot and cold weather, and they need to be kept as house dogs.

-Boxers mature slowly and act like rambunctious puppies for several years.

-Boxers don't just like to be around their family--they need to be around them! If left alone for too long or kept in the backyard away from people, they can become ill-tempered and destructive.

-Boxers drool, a lot. Boxers also snore, loudly.

-Although they have short hair, Boxers shed, especially in the spring.

-Boxers are intelligent and respond well to firm but fun training. They also have an independent streak and don't like to be bossed around or treated harshly. You'll have the biggest success in training your Boxer if you can make it fun for them.

-Some Boxers take their guarding duties a little too seriously, while others may not exhibit any guarding instincts at all.
