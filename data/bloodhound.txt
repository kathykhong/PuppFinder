BloodHound Highlights

-This is a very active breed, not the lazy dog you may have seen portrayed on The Beverly Hillbillies. Bloodhounds are working dogs and need long daily walks or runs.

-Bloodhounds are not suited for apartment living. They do best in a home with a large fenced yard.

-Bloodhounds are pack dogs and will enjoy the company of other dogs. A cat will do in a pinch.

-Bloodhounds slobber and shed. Keep baby wipes or hand towels on hand throughout the house, and brush them weekly or more often if needed.

-Bloodhounds love and are extremely tolerant with them. Teach children how to treat a Bloodhound properly and supervise play between them. Bloodhounds may be too large for toddlers; they can knock them down with a single swipe of the tail.

-Bloodhounds need a fenced yard. This is not an option but a necessity. If they come across an interesting scent, they will follow it, head down, nose to the ground, eyes covered by their wonderful ears, oblivious to traffic and other dangers.

-For the same reason you need a fenced yard, you need to walk a Bloodhound on leash.

-Known for their stubbornness, Bloodhounds need an owner who is firm, loving, and consistent. A Bloodhound who is mistreated or feels he is mistreated will pout and hide. Bloodhounds do well with positive reinforcement training.

-Bloodhounds are prone to recurring ear infections. Routinely check their ears and clean them on a regular basis.

-Bloodhounds will chew and swallow the most unimaginable items, from rocks and plants to batteries and TV remotes.

-When they're not following a trail, Bloodhounds prefer to live indoors with the family.

-To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
