Samoyed Highlights

-The Samoyed's white, fluffy coat is beautiful, but to keep it in good condition requires rigorous grooming.

-Shedding could be the Samoyed's middle name — he does so profusely once or twice a year. Expect to brush the dog and vacuum your home daily during shedding season.

-The Samoyed doesn't like to sit around — he likes to be busy. Keep him active with walks, games, hikes, and canine sports.

-The Samoyed's characteristic smile reveals his friendly, good-natured disposition. He is especially fond of children.

-To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
