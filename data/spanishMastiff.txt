Spanish Mastiff Highlights

-Spanish Mastiff coats can come in a variety of colors. They can range from black to fawn, red, brindle, tri-colored, or almost any mixture of those colors.

-Their coats shed, especially seasonally, and they're not considered allergy-friendly. The coat is not very difficult to care for and only requires a weekly brushing with an occasional bath.

-Spanish Mastiffs make very little noise, but when they do, expect a deep and intimidating bark that will no doubt ward off any strangers, seeing as they are very skeptical of new people.

-The Spanish Mastiff has an independent personality. While they're very intelligent, they will often do what they please. Obedience training can pose a challenge to those without strong personality types, and they do best with experienced dog owners.

-Spanish Mastiffs are prone to hip and joint issues, so make sure your pup maintains a healthy weight. These dogs tend to be fairly inactive while indoors but will need a slow paced walk once or twice a day and a large yard to roam around in to burn off extra energy.

-Spanish Mastiffs are sturdy pups, and they love to play with children. The size of these dogs makes it very important to always supervise playtime with children because they can accidentally cause injury to a small child, but they are very protective of kids in their families.

-Spanish Mastiffs are very territorial by nature and will not typically enjoy the presence of another dog, and some may even express aggression towards cats and dogs in their home. They may be best off as solo pets in the household.
