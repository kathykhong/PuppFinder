Icelandic Sheep Dog Highlights

-It's thought that invading Vikings brought the ancestors of this breed with them to Iceland in the ninth century. Thanks to the isolation of Iceland, today's Icelandic Sheepdogs — also called the Icelandic Spitz or Icelandic Dog — probably look a lot like their ancestors.

-For centuries the Icelandic Sheepdog was used to protect flocks, especially lambs, from birds of prey, and to this day he retains the habit of watching the sky and barking at birds. He also barks to alert his family to anything and everything that he sees or hears. He's too friendly to be much of a guard dog, but you'll never be surprised by visitors.

-Affectionate, confident, and playful, the Icelandic Sheepdog gets along well with people and other dogs. Males tend to be more laidback and cuddly than females. Trained with consistency and patience, Icelandics learn quickly and willingly.
