Pekingese Highlights

-Due to their short noses, Pekes snore, some quite loudly.

-The round bulging eye of the Pekingese can be damaged or "popped out" during excessively rough play; this is rare but can occur.

-Pekes have an excessive amount of wrinkling on face; this can cause problems with skin fold dermatitis, skin irritations, and infections. The folds should be kept clean and dry.

-Pekes have a tendency to gain weight if overfed.

-A Peke may go on a hunger strike just to prove a point over his owner.

-Pekingese tend to bark a lot.

-The breed can be difficult to housebreak.

-Pekingese tend to be one-person dogs.

-Because of their profuse coat and short noses, they do not tolerate heat well.

-To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
