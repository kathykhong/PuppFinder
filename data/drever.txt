Drever Highlights

-The colors of the Drever's coat are primarily brindle, fawn, red, and tri-colored. They can also have markings in sable or white. Their coats are easy to groom. A good brushing per week will probably do.

-Drevers were bred to be trackers for hunters but are very affectionate to their owners and love to cuddle if they're indoors.

-The Drever is strong-willed and needs a strong trainer. They can make good watchdogs and will bark at the first sign of what they sense is trouble.

-Drevers have high energy levels. Make sure your dog gets at least one good half-hour to hour-long walk per day with a few good, active play sessions and shorter walks mixed in.

-Drevers aren't naturally fond of other animals and may prefer to be the solo pet in the household. Still, many Drevers get along just fine with other dogs, so it really comes down to training, socialization, and the luck of the draw.

-Most Drevers are fine with kids but may prefer older children who know how to properly and gently interact with pets.
