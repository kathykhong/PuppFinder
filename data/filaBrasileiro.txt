Fila Brasileiro Highlights

-Fila Brasileiros have high energy levels. Make sure your dog gets at least two to three good half-hour- to hour-long walks per day with a few good, active play sessions and shorter walks mixed in.

-The Fila Brasileiro's coat can be brindle, fawn, or black. Sometimes, a Fila may have a black mask.

-Their coats are smooth and short-haired, and they shed regularly. This means they don't make great choices for allergy sufferers.

-Your Fila may not take well to other kids, like playmates, so it is important to set up boundaries for both the dog and kids. Teach your children how to properly interact with your Fila Brasileiro to prevent any unwanted injuries.

-Filas can get along with other dogs their size but tend to view anything smaller as prey. Even with consistent training, Filas are hard-wired to chase down small animals like cats and smaller pups, and will likely be best suited as the only animal in the home.

-The Brazilian Mastiff was bred to be loyal only to their owners, which means that consistent and early socialization is key to raising a Fila Brasileiro who won't become aggressive around visitors or strangers.
