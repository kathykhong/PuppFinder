Ibizan Houmd Highlights

-Ibizan Hounds do well in apartments if they are properly exercised.

-They must be kept on leash whenever they are not in a securely fenced area. Beezers have a strong prey drive and will pursue moving objects heedless of your commands.

-Ibizan Hounds are excellent jumpers. It takes at least a 6-foot fence to confine them to a yard. Underground electronic fences are not recommended for this breed.

-Beezers need daily exercise. If their exercise requirements are not met, they can become bored and destructive.

-Male Ibizan Hounds may develop poor appetites when they are adolescents. Encourage them to eat, but don't go overboard with food bribes, elaborate meals, or hand feeding; you'll simply end up with a picky eater.

-Beezers become cold easily. If you live in a cold or wet climate, purchase a coat for your dog.

-Ibizan Hounds are excellent with children, but all dogs should be supervised when they are with young children.

-These dogs are generally quiet indoors and can become couch potatoes but they need a daily walk or run.

-Ibizan Hounds are expert counter surfers so don't leave food out, even if you think it's out of your dog's reach.

-Ibizan Hounds are generally not aggressive but they do have a high prey drive and are not best suited for homes with small animals. They can learn to get along with cats if they're raised with them, but outdoor cats and other animals are fair game.

-Ibizan Hounds are a rare breed. Expect to spend time on a waiting list if you're interested in one of these dogs.

-To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
