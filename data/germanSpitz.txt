German Spitz Highlights

-The Standard German Spitz comes in a wider variety of coat colors than some of its Spitz cousins, including black, brown, orange, wolf gray, and white.

-The German Spitz has a double coat; the undercoat is soft, short, and wooly, and over it, a long, fibrous layer makes up the topcoat. They'll need a good brushing several times a week.

-Because the German Spitz is a small dog, they can be easily injured by overly excited children. German Spitzes prefer to be mostly around adults or older kids who know how to play gently.

-These dogs have high energy levels. Make sure they get at least one good half-hour- to hour-long walk per day with a few good, active play sessions and shorter walks mixed in.

-These small pups can be wary of strangers and are vocal, so they might bark around people they don't know. They have a high pitch bark that sounds "yappy" to some.

-German Spitzes have a high prey drive and enjoy games where they can chase toys.

-German Spitzes are intelligent, but can be stubborn. They need strong-willed, consistent trainers.
