Gordon Setter Highlights

-Adult Gordon Setters require one to two hours of daily exercise. This can be a game of fetch in a field or backyard, a run, or a couple of long walks.

-Gordon Setters do well with children and may be protective of the children in their family. In general, they make wonderful, caring companions for children and their whole family. It is important to remember that dogs and small children should never be left unsupervised, regardless of breed.

-Being an intelligent, hardworking breed, the Gordon Setter can become destructive if his needs for exercise and mental stimulation are not met. Boredom and extra energy are not a great mix to have, and the best way to avoid any destructiveness is through proper exercise and training.

-Gordon Setters are not backyard dogs. They are much happier when they are with their families and should not live away from them. They enjoy personal attention and family activities.

-Gordon Setters are generally rambunctious when they are young but usually become gentle and calm as they get older.

-Strong temperaments are well known in the breed and many owners have the feeling that they are "owned" and not owner. Gordons are independent and determined, qualities that can translate to stubbornness to some.

-Gordon Setters make excellent watchdogs and are wary of strangers. They may seem aloof to some but are loving toward their own family.

-Barking is not uncommon in the breed, and Gordons will bark to express their likes, dislikes, and other emotions, including whether they think you should have taken them with you when you left.

-Gordon Setters can suffer from separation anxiety and may become destructive when they do.

-Gordon Setters shed, and their coat requires more than minimal grooming. If you do not have the time needed to properly groom them, this may not be the breed for you.

-Although many Gordon Setters get along well with other animals, some may be aggressive toward other dogs. Socialization is important for all dogs and should be started as possible.

-Gordon Setters are not recommended for apartment living. Although they are generally quiet indoors, they need a large fenced yard to exercise in. They love to run so a fenced yard is a must.

-Although Gordon Setters are known for their stubbornness, they can be sensitive and easily cowed with abuse and neglect. Never treat your dog harshly but instead give him firm, fair, consistent training without the use of anger or physical force. If Gordon Setters aren't trained they may become destructive, wilful, and dominant.

-To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from a backyard breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
