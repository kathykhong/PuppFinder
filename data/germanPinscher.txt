German Pinscher Highlights

-The German Pinscher is not recommended for homes with children under the age of nine.

-A working breed, they need daily exercise and cannot be left untrained or unexercised. Expect a healthy amount of exercise each day to curb negative behaviors.

-The German Pinscher can fare all right in an apartment as long as they're walked at least twice a day. However, they're better suited to a home that has a fenced yard.

-They have a strong prey drive and will chase anything that they deem worth chasing. They should be kept on lead while not in a secured area, and fences should be secure enough that they can't slip through them.

-The German Pinscher is a strong-willed breed that needs a consistent and firm owner. They have been known to take over a home if rules are not set when they're young. With training and consistency, however, the German Pinscher will learn quickly and well.

-Naturally suspicious of strangers, the German Pinschers makes an excellent guard dog. By the same token, they need to be socialized from a young age to prevent the development of aggressive behavior.

-The German Pinscher enjoys jumping up to greet loved ones, but proper training can correct this trait.

-They will alert bark, and they have a strong, loud voice, but they won't bark unnecessarily.

-They thrive when they're part of a family and can participate in family activities. This isn't a breed who can live outside, and they're unhappy being forgotten while life is busy.

-The German Pinscher can become destructive when bored. They're also known for their ability to gut toys at an alarming rate.

-Never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look into shelters or rescues if this is the breed for you.
