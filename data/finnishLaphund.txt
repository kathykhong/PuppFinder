Finnish Laphund Highlights

-No, his name doesn't mean lapdog. This smart, hard-working dog originated in Lapland, in Finland's far north, where he was used to herd reindeer for the semi-nomadic Sami people. These days, he still has a strong herding instinct that can be put to use with more common varieties of livestock. He can also enjoy other dog jobs such as agility, obedience, and therapy work.

-Friendly toward people and gentle with children, he's a good companion for people who don't mind a dog with a long, profuse coat.
