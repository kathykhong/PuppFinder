Papillon Highlights

-Papillons do not do well in environments where there is little time for the dog. They will choose to be never separated from their human companions.

-Puppies are fragile and can be injured by rough and tumble play. They are not suitable for families with very small children.

-Papillons are among the breeds sensitive to anesthesia. Keep this in mind when scheduling any surgical procedure.

-To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
