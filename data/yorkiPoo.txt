Yorki Poo Highlights

-The Yorkipoo is a designer dog and is the result of Yorkshire Terrier to Toy or Miniature Poodle breedings. There's been an increase in multigenerational breeding (Yorkipoo to Yorkipoo), and also in Yorkipoo to Poodle or Yorkipoo to Yorkshire Terrier breeding; but many litters are first generation, the result of breeding two purebred parents.

-A Yorkipoo is active and energetic, as are both Poodles and Yorkies. He requires daily exercise and does well with a good walk or romp in the yard.

-Barking is a favorite pastime. Occasionally a Yorkipoo can be trained to bark less, but expect to hear the noise whenever someone comes to the door. He has no clue that his bark doesn't terrify anyone.

-He is a non- to low-shedder and can make an excellent companion for people with allergies.

-Daily brushing is needed to keep his fine, silky coat free of tangles and mats.

-Loving and gentle, the Yorkipoo can make an excellent companion to older, more considerate children. Like most toy breeds, he's not recommended for homes with very young children.

-He's easy to train if you use positive reinforcement. He's got a stubborn streak, though, so expect some occasional resistance.

-The Yorkipoo can live very happily in an apartment.

-He generally does well with other dogs and pets.

-A companion dog, he may suffer from separation anxiety when left alone for long periods at a time.

-To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
