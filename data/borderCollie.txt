Border Collie Highlights

-The Border Collie is highly sensitive, often responsive to the subtlest command and seemingly able to predict his owner's desires in advance.

-A workaholic who thrives on mental and physical stimulation, the Border Collie must have a positive way to direct his energy. Otherwise he'll invent his own games â€” and he can become a problem to live with.

-The Border Collie will herd anything that moves, including children, cars, people on bikes, cats, and squirrels. He can become a real problem if he's allowed to roam in a neighborhood; a securely fenced yard is essential.

-The noisy play of young children can stimulate the Border Collie's herding instinct and cause him to nip, nudge, and bark.

-To prevent shyness, the Border Collie must be well socialized.

-The Border Collie doesn't usually roam, but his curiosity and intelligence can lead him to become an escape artist.

-To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
