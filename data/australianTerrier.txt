Australian Terrier Highlights

-The Aussie is all terrier, and not everyone finds his favorite hobbies endearing: he loves to bark, dig, and chase.

-Bossy is the Aussie's middle name. He wants to be the dominant dog in a multidog household (males can be cranky with other male dogs). In fact, he'll happily take over the role of pack leader among people, too â€” so be sure to establish yourself as the boss before he does.

-Early training and socialization are musts to keep this dog happy and well liked by family and friends, both human and animal.

-The Aussie's personality is active and lively. If you prefer a dog with a more subdued nature, look at other breeds first.

-To get a healthy pet, never buy a puppy from a backyard breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Find a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs for genetic health conditions and good temperaments.
