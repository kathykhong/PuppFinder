Vizsla Highlights

-Vizslas are an active breed and need at least 60 minutes of exercise every day. They enjoy long walks, jogging, and playing fetch, as well as dog sports.

-Vizslas are low to moderate shedders and need only weekly brushings to keep them free of loose hair. They rarely need baths and don't have a strong doggy odor.

-Vizslas thrive on human companionship. They'll follow family members from room to room and like to be touching or touched by their people.

-Vizslas aren't recommended for people who work long hours. Vizslas can suffer from separation anxiety, which can lead to destructive behaviors.

-Vizslas tend to be chewers. Keep your Vizsla supplied with plenty of chew toys to protect your possessions.

-Vizslas do best in homes with fenced yards where they can safely run and play.

-Vizslas should live in the home with the family, not outside. Their coat doesn't protect them from cold temperatures and they can't thrive without human companionship.

-Although they aren't recommended for homes with young kids, Vizslas are very affectionate with children and can make great companions for older, energetic kids.

-Training and socialization is a must with this breed. They can be difficult to handle if they aren't properly trained and they can become shy and timid if they're not properly socialized.

-Vizslas do well with other dogs and will even get along with cats if they're raised with them. However, they're not a good fit for homes that have small pets such as rabbits, gerbils, guinea pigs, or birds.

-To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from a puppy mill, a pet store, or from a breeder who doesn't provide health clearances or guarantees. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies and breeds for sound temperaments.

-If you're buying a puppy, meet the puppy's parents â€” they're an indicator of what your pup's future personality might be like. They should be friendly and sociable, not high-strung or overly shy.
