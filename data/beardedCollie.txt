Bearded Collie Highlights

-Beardies don't like to be confined and may become nuisance barkers if frequently left alone.

-Beardies require about an hour of exercise daily in a fenced area where they can run.

-Beardies can be headstrong, so obedience training is a must. Start early!

-Bearded Collies will bark to let you know people are approaching, but they are not guard dogs of any kind.

-A bored Beardie is an excellent escape artist!

-The Bearded Collie coat requires weekly brushing, more during their annual shedding season.

-Some Beardies can react to monthly heartworm preventive. Discuss this with your veterinarian to decide whether a daily preventive is a better choice.

-To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from a backyard breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
